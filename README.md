# **Header file for Sets in C language**
Are you willing to perform some operations on sets like, creating sets, union of two sets, intersection of two sets, difference of two sets etc. and couldn't find any standard library in C for doing all these?

If yes, then you're at the right place!!

This repo contains a header file which can do all the above mentioned operations of sets with ease.

## **How to access the file?**

1. Simple, just clone this repo and use place the header file in the same folder of where it should be used.

2. Then, just create a .c file in the same folder where the header is placed.

3. Finally, include the header by using,

    **#include"set.h"**

    at the top of your code.

4. That's it, you can now use all the functions in the header file in your code.

**For more information on the functions in the header file, go ahead and open the 'Header_File' folder present in this repo**

## **HAPPY CODING :)**
